## Summary

A website built around a fantasy football league that started in 2020 with some new and refreshing rules. The home page displays the current leader in the league, along with the person with the highest and lowest points. There's also a profile page for each of the twelve managers with a small bio, their current stats, and their current starting roster. Along with the About page, the site has a section dedicated for the podcast with an embedded podcast player.
